# Data Deletion Request Instruction

Last updated: March 27, 2023

If you no longer wish to use our services and want to delete your account and data from our system, you can do so by sending an email to admin@rehabestimator.app with the subject line "Account Deletion Request". In the body of the email, please include the following information:

- Your full name
- Your email address associated with the account you want to delete
- A brief reason for your request

Once we receive your email, we will process your request as soon as possible. Please note that once your account is deleted, all your personal data will be permanently removed from our system and cannot be restored.

## Why Do We Need Your Information?

We take the privacy and security of our users' personal information very seriously. We collect and use your data only for legitimate business purposes and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

However, if you no longer want us to hold your data, we respect your right to request its deletion. By providing us with the necessary information, you help us identify and locate your account and ensure that we delete the right data.

## How Long Will It Take to Process Your Request?

We aim to process all account deletion requests as soon as possible. However, please note that it may take up to 7 business days for us to complete the process. During this time, you may still receive emails from us, but we will ensure that they contain information on how to unsubscribe from our services.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about your account deletion request or our privacy policy, please contact us at admin@rehabestimator. We will be happy to assist you.

We value your trust and appreciate your business. Thank you for choosing our services.
